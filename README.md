## 1. Getting setup with Git

`git remote add origin git@github.com:develop-me/drupal1.git`

The above command sets the github repository's origin to the local master file that you have created on your computer. After you have initialised to work with git on your system, you can then create a repository in your github account and allow others to contribute to the same project if you share the repository with them.
